# Quantum-Generator
Thesis for the Computer Science degree at the Facultat di'Inform√†tica de Barcelona (FIB - UPC)


## Purpose of the project

The final goal of this thesis is to help
researchers increase the number of qubits in quantum computers by developing
a synthetic quantum algorithm generator that could be used to benchmark quantum computers and quantum technologies. This tool
will facilitate the benchmarking process of quantum computers by increasing
and improving the set of structured quantum circuits available for testing. By
creating this tool, our project aims to accelerate the research and progress of
quantum computing.



## Parts of the code

The code can be dicided into three parts:

-  The first part (2 cells of code) is dedicated to the instalation of the required packages to use the code
-  The second part (cells until "Test" section) includes the initializations and declarations of the required functions in order to use the code. Each function is brefely explained.
-  The last part is the "Test Zone" where executions of the generator can be performed, creating like this the synthetic circuits. Furthermore, the evaluation metrics can also be obtained on this zone.
